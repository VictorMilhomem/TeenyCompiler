# Teeny Tiny Comp√≠ler

The Teeny Tiny Compiler is a [project from Austin Z. Henley](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) about
<br>compilers, for this project he made a simple grammar for the compiler
<br>and the compiler it self he wrote in Python.
<br>So I decided to rewrite his project in C++.
